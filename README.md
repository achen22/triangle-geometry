# Triangle Geometry

This web page takes three vertices on a cartesian plane and displays some information about the triangle they create, including:
- the side lengths of the triangle
- the [type of triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle#Types_of_triangle)
- the area and perimeter of the triangle

## How to Use
Data input via `.csv` file. Each line must contain 6 numbers separated by commas (`,`). For example, the line

> ```1,2,3,4,5,6```

would show information about the triangle formed by the points (1, 2), (3, 4) and (5, 6).
